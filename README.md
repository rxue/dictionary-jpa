*dictionary-jpa* generates 2 types of jars with different usage
* *uber-JAR* whose name ends with `-uber` after the version number: used to generate dictionary  database schema
* normal jar: used as a dependency for CRUD operations on a database with schema generated by the *uber-JAR* above

# How to Use
## How to use the *uber-JAR*
Pre-requisite: Generation of the database schema needs a database. The database should be configured either on base of https://github.com/rxue/dictionary-jpa/blob/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml or user should overwrite the properties in the `peristence.xml` through command line below

1. Download the *uber-JAR* from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/rxue/dictionary-jpa/1.4/dictionary-jpa-1.4-uber.jar
2. run command: `java -jar dictionary-jpa-1.4-uber.jar` or `java -D<property> -jar dictionary-jpa-1.4-uber.jar` to overwrite the properties in [persistence.xml](https://github.com/rxue/dictionary-jpa/blob/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml) 


## Repository Design with JPA
## Interface design: `LexicalItemRepository` and `ExplanationRepository`

Think first from the frontend point of view:

**CREATE**
 * ~add a full *lexical entry* including *lexical item*, *defintion*, *part of speech*, *example sentences* etc.~
 * ~add a single *explanationEntity* to an existing *lexical entry*~

**READ** 

 * Given an keyword with value, language and definition language, get all the possible results along with all meanings
 * ~Given a *lexical item id* get the all the explanationEntities~ (no real case realized yet)

**UPDATE**

 * ~Given a *lexical item*, update it (explanationEntities can be added or removed)~
 * ~Given an *explanationEntity*, update it~

**DELETE**

 * Given a *lexical item* delete it (not implemented yet)
 * ~Given an *explanationEntity*, delete it~

**Unidirectional `@ManyToOne` Association (`Explanation` > `LexicalItem`)**

**CREATE**
 * add a full *lexical entry* including *lexical item*, *defintion*, *part of speech*, *example sentences* etc. : (can be done purely through `ExplanationRepository`)

**READ** 

 * Given an input, get all the possible results along with all meanings: OK (can be done purely through `ExplanationRepository`)
 * ~Given a *lexical item id* get the all the explanationEntities : OK but the query on `ExplanationRepository` is not trivial~

**UPDATE**

 * ~Given a *lexical item*, update it (explanationEntities can be added or removed) : need separate merge on both `LexicalItem` and `Explanation`~

**DELETE**

 * ~Given a *lexical item* delete it : need first `LexicalItemRepository.find`/`EntityManager.find` to search for the managed entity and thEN call `EntityManager.remove`~

~This design strategy cannot simply meet the repositories.~ 

## Current Design Conclusion on base of *prototyping* trial

After trying the bidirectional `@ManyToOne` association from `Explanation` back to `DictionaryEntry`, and then gradually tweaking back to unidirectional, unidirectional `@ManyToOne` association is eventually decided to be used
